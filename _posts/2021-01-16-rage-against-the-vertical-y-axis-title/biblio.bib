    abstract = { There are numerous design situations in which it impossible to present English text in its normal horizontal orientation. There are multiple options available when text must be presented vertically: rotating horizontal text 90Â° to the left or to the right, or in a downward cascade of letters such as on a theater marquee. While it seems intuitive that horizontal text will be recognized faster than vertical text, which presentation format is best for vertical text? An experiment was conducted to investigate, and found that marquee text is indeed read more slowly than rotated text, and that rotated text is read more slowly than standard horizontal text. However, no evidence was found for a difference between left- and right-rotated text. Word frequency effects were larger in all vertical conditions relative to the horizontal control. These results suggest that rotated text is generally to be preferred to marquee-style presentation. }
