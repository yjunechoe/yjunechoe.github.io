## Intro

I've been seeing a [couple](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2023-12-18-2023-year-in-review/) [folks](https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-12-23-year-review/) on Mastodon sharing their "year in review" blog posts, and I thought that was really cool, so I decided to write my own too! I'm mostly documenting for myself but hopefully this also serves as an update of a sort for my internet friends since I've been pretty silent online this year.

## Research

Being the good grad student I am, I'm forefronting my academia happenings first. In numbers, I published **one paper**, gave **two talks**, and presented **three posters**. I'm not super proud of those numbers: I think they're a lot less than what people might expect from a 4th year PhD student. But a lot of effort went into each^[I was the first author for all research that I presented, as is often the case in linguistics.] and 2023 overall has been a great year for refining and narrowing down on my dissertation topic. I did a ton of readings and I hope it pays off for next year when I actually get started on writing the thing.

I already document my research happenings [elsewhere](https://yjunechoe.github.io/research.html) and I know that my primarily audience isn't linguists, so I won't expand on that more here.

## Blogging

2023 was the year when it became [painfully obvious to me](https://fosstodon.org/@yjunechoe/110437295974710184) that I don't have much in terms of a *portfolio* in the sense of the buzzword-y "data science portfolio" that industry recruiters purportedly look for. This ironically coincided with another realization I had, which is that I'm increasingly becoming "the department tech/stats guy" where I take on many small tasks and favors from faculty and other students here and there; I truly do enjoy doing this work, but it's completely invisible to my CV/resume. I'm still navigating this weird position I'm in, but I've found some nice tips^[Like [this blog post](https://www.phillipalday.com/blog/2013/02/19/Backups-Your-Relationship-to-Your-Data-and-Your-IT-Guy/).] and at least I still have another year until I'm on the job market to fully figure this out.

The reason why I put the above rant under the "Blogging" section is because **my blog is the closest thing I have a portfolio** - there's not much here, but it's a public-facing space I own where I get to show people what I know and how I think. So in 2023 I was more conscious about what I blog about and how. The change was subtle - my blog persona is still my usual self, but I've tried to **diversify the _style_ of my blogs**. Whereas I mostly wrote long-form, tutorial-style blog posts in the past, I only wrote one such post ([on `dplyr::slice()`](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-06-11-row-relational-operations/)) this year. My other blog posts were one reflecting on [how to better answer other people's questions](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-07-09-x-y-problem/), and another where I [nerd out on the internals of {tidyselect}](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-12-03-untidy-select/) with little regard for its practicality.^[A style heavily inspired by some of my favorite R bloggers like [Matt Dray](https://www.rostrum.blog/) and [Jonathan Carroll](https://jcarroll.com.au/)].

All in all, I wrote **three blog posts** this year (not including this one). This is the usual rate of publishing blog posts for me, but I hope to write more frequently next year (and write shorter posts overall, and in less formal tone).

## R stuff

I didn't think I'd have much to say about the R stuff I did this year until I sat down to write this blog. Even though this year was the busiest I've ever been with research, it turns out that I still ended up doing quite a bit of R stuff in my free time. I'll cover this chronologically.

At the beginning of the year, I was really lucky to receive the [student paper award](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/student-paper-competition) from the [Statistical Computing and Graphics section of the ASA](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/home), writing about [{ggtrace}](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/).^[Coincidentally, my girlfriend also won a student award this year from another ASA - the Acoustical Society of America.] In the [paper](https://yjunechoe.github.io/static/papers/Choe_2022_SublayerGG.pdf), I focused on `{ggtrace}` as a pedagogical tool for aspiring `{ggplot2}` extension developers. In the process, I rediscovered the power of **reframing ggplot internals as data wrangling** and went back to `{ggtrace}` to add a couple [convenience functions](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/news/index.html#ggtrace-development-version-3) for interactive use-cases. After over two years since its inception, `{ggtrace}` now feels pretty complete in terms of its core features.

<img src="https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/logo.png" style="width:20%;margin:1em auto;display:block;">

In Spring, I began writing [{jlmerclusterperm}](https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/), a statistical package implementing the cluster-based permutation test for time series data, using mixed-effects models. This was a new challenge for me for two reasons. First, I wrote much of the package [in Julia](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm/tree/main/inst/julia/JlmerClusterPerm/src) - this was my first time writing Julia code for "production" and within an R package.^[I can't recommend `{JuliaConnectoR}` enough for this.] Second, I wrote this package for a seminar on eye movements that I was taking that Spring in the psychology department. I wrote `{jlmerclusterperm}` in an intense burst - most of it was complete by the end of May and I turned in the package as my final.^[I'm actually quite proud of myself for pulling this off - writing an R package for the final was unprecedented for the class.] I also gave a school-internal [talk](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/calendar_event/ilst-seminar-students/) on it in April; my first time talking about R in front of an entirely academic audience.

In Summer, I continued polishing `{jlmerclusterperm}` with another ambitious goal of getting it to CRAN, at the suggestion of a couple researchers who said they'd like to use it for their own research. The already-hard task of getting through **my first CRAN submission** was compounded by the fact that the package contained Julia code - it took *nine resubmissions in the span of two months* to finally get `{jlmerclusterperm}` stably on CRAN.^[In the process, I received the elusive CRAN Note for exceeding 6 updates in under a month (CRAN recommends one update every 1-2 months).]

At the beginning of Fall, I attended the [Advanced Frequentist stream](https://repsychling.github.io/SMLP2023/) of the [SMLP2023](https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2023/) workshop, taught by Phillip Alday, Reinhold Kliegl and Douglas Bates. The topic was **mixed-effects regression models in Julia**, one that I became very excited about especially after working on `{jlmerclusterperm}`. It was an absolute blast and I wish that everyone in linguistics/psychology research appreciated good stats/data analysis as much as the folks I met there. The workshop was far away in Germany (my first time ever in Europe!) and I'm really thankful to [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/) for giving me a grant to help with travel expenses.

For most of Fall, I didn't do much R stuff, especially with the start of the Fall semester and a big conference looming on the horizon. But the little time I did spend on it, I worked on maintenance and upkeep for `{openalexR}`, one of my few collaborative projects. It's also one of the few packages for which I'm an author of that I actually frequently use myself. I used `{openalexR}` a lot during the Fall semester for conducting literature reviews in preparation for my dissertation proposal, so I had a few opportunities to catch bugs and work on other improvements. I also spent a lot of my time in the Fall TA-ing for an [undergraduate data science class](https://kathrynschuler.com/datasci/) that we recently started offering in our department. This was actually my third year in a row TA-ing it, so it went pretty smoothly. I even learned some new [quirky R behaviors](https://fosstodon.org/@yjunechoe/111026163637396686) from my students along the way.

In October, I virtually attended the [R/Pharma conference](https://rinpharma.com/) and joined a [workshop](https://github.com/rich-iannone/pointblank-workshop) on data validation using the `{pointblank}` package by [Rich Iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone). I had used `{pointblank}` a little before, but I didn't explore its features much because I thought it had some odd behaviors that I couldn't comprehend. The workshop cleared up some of the confusion for me, and Rich made it clear in the workshop that he welcomed contributions to improve the package. So I [made a PR](https://github.com/rstudio/pointblank/pull/493) addressing the biggest pain point I personally had with using `{pointblank}`. This turned out to be a pretty big undertaking which took over a month to complete. In the process, I become a co-author of `{pointblank}`, and I merged a series of PRs that improved the consistency of function designs, among other things.

The last R thing I did this year was actually secretly Julia - in December I gave a school-internal [workshop](https://github.com/yjunechoe/MindCORE-julia-mixedmodels) on fitting mixed effects in Julia, geared towards an academic audience with experience in R. I advocated for a middle-ground approach where you can keep doing everything in R and RStudio, except move the modelling workflow into Julia. I live-coded some Julia code and ran it from RStudio^[Using some tricks described in the workshop materials.] which I think wasn't too difficult to grasp. I have a half-baked package of addins to make R-Julia interoperability smoother in RStudio; this might become my next full project.

That brings me to the present moment, where I'm currently taking a break from FOSS to focus on my research, as my dissertation proposal defense is coming up soon. I will continue to be responsive with maintaining `{jlmerclusterperm}` during this time (since there's an active user-base of researchers who find it useful) but my other projects will become low priority. I also don't think I'll be starting a new project any time soon, but in the near future I hope I come up with something cool that lets me test-drive `{S7}`!

## Personal

This year, I tried to be less of a workaholic. I think I did an okay job at it, and it came in the form of diversifying my hobbies (R used to be my only hobby since starting grad school). I got back into ice skating^[I used to play ice hockey competitively as a kid.] and, briefly, swimming,^[Turns out that swimming does not play well with my preexisting ear conditions.] and I'm fortunate that both are available literally two blocks away from my department. My girlfriend and I got really into escape rooms this year, mostly playing online ones due to budget constraints.^[Most recently we played [Hallows Hill](https://wolfescapegames.com/en-us/products/hallows-hill-the-virtual-escape-room-experience) which I think is the best one we've played so far] I also got back into playing Steam games and racked up over 300 hours on [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/), mostly from the ~2 weeks recovering from covid in September.^[For the fellow nerds, I reached A20 on Ironclad, Defect, and Watcher. I'm working my way up for Silent.]

And of course, I have many people to thank for making this a wonderful year.^[I'm feeling shy so this goes in the footnotes. In roughly chronological order, I'm firstly indebted to Sam Tyner-Monroe who encouraged me write up `{ggtrace}` for the ASA paper award after my rstudio::conf talk on it last year. I'm grateful to Gina Reynolds and Teun van den Brand (and others in the [ggplot extension club](https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club)) for engaging in many insightful data viz/ggplot internals discussions with me. I'm also grateful to my FOSS collaborators, especially Trang Le, from whom I've learned a lot about code review and package design principles while working on `{openalexR}` together. Last but not least, I owe a lot to Daniel Sjoberg and Shannon Pileggi for a recent development that I'm not ready to publicly share yet 🤫.] Happy new year to all!
