## Introduction

### Happy pipes

Modern day programming with R is all about pipes.^[So much so that there's going to be a native pipe operator!] You start out with some object that undergoes incremental changes as it is passed (piped) into a chain of functions and finally returned as the desired output, like in this simple example. ^[Taken from [Advanced R Ch. 6](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#function-composition)]

```{r}
set.seed(2021) # Can 2020 be over already?

square <- function(x) x^2
deviation <- function(x) x - mean(x)

nums <- runif(100)

nums %>%
  deviation() %>%
  square() %>%
  mean() %>%
  sqrt()
```

When we pipe (or pass anything through any function, for that matter), we often do one distinct thing at a time, like in the above example.

So, we rarely have a chain of functions that look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(kmpg = mpg/1.6) %>% 
  mutate(disp = round(disp)) %>% 
  select(-vs) %>% 
  select(-am) %>% 
  select(-gear) %>% 
  select(-carb) %>% 
  filter(mpg > 15) %>% 
  filter(cyl == 6) %>% 
  filter(wt < 3)
```

... because many functions are vectorized, or designed to handle multiple values by other means, like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  mutate(kmpg = mpg/1.6, disp = round(disp)) %>% 
  select(-(vs:carb)) %>% 
  filter(mpg > 15, cyl == 6, wt < 3)
```

### Sad (repetitive) pipes

But some functions do not handle multiple inputs the way we want it to, or just not at all. Here are some examples of what I'm talking about.

In **{ggplot2}**, this doesn't plot 3 overlapping points with sizes 8, 4, and 2:

```{r, error = TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + 
  geom_point(size = c(8, 4, 2), alpha = .5)
```

So you have to do this:

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + 
  geom_point(size = 8, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)
```

In **{kableExtra}**, this doesn't color the third column "skyblue", the fourth column "forestgreen", and the fifth column "chocolate":^[If you aren't familiar with {kableExtra}, you just need to know that `column_spec()` can take a column index as its first argument and a color as the `background` argument to set the background color of a column to the provided color. And as we see here, if a color vector is passed into `background`, it's just recycled to color the rows which is not what we want.]

```{r, warning = TRUE}
library(kableExtra)

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  column_spec(3:5, background = c("skyblue", "forestgreen", "chocolate"))
```

So you have to do this:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  column_spec(3, background = "skyblue") %>% 
  column_spec(4, background = "forestgreen") %>% 
  column_spec(5, background = "chocolate")
```

In **{dplyr}**, this doesn't make 3 new columns named "a", "b", and "c", all filled with `NA`:^[If this is your first time seeing the "bang bang" `!!` operator and the "walrus" `:=` operator being used this way, check out the [documentation on quasiquotation](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/quasiquotation.html).]

```{r, error = TRUE}
new_cols <- c("a", "b", "c")

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols := NA)
```

So you have to do either one of these:^[For those of you more familiar with quasiquation in {dplyr}, I should also mention that using "big bang" `!!!` like in `mutate(!!!new_cols := NA)` doesn't work either. As far as I know, `:=` is just an alias of `=` for the {rlang} parser, and as we know `=` cannot assign more than one variable at once (unlike Python, for example), which explains the error.]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(
    !!new_cols[1] := NA,
    !!new_cols[2] := NA,
    !!new_cols[3] := NA
  )

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[1] := NA) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[2] := NA) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[3] := NA)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
new_cols <- c("a", "b", "c")

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(
    !!new_cols[1] := NA,
    !!new_cols[2] := NA,
    !!new_cols[3] := NA
  )
```

So we've got functions being repeated, but in all these cases it looks like **we can't just throw in a vector and expect the function to loop/map over them internally in the specific way that we want it to**. And the "correct ways" I provided here are not very satisfying: that's a lot of copying and pasting! 

Personally, I think it'd be nice to collapse these repetitive calls - but how?

### Introducing purrr::reduce()

The `reduce()` function from the {[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)} package is a powerful functional that allows you to abstract away from a sequence of functions that are applied in a fixed direction. You should go give [Advanced R Ch. 9.5](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html) a read if you want an in-depth explanation, but here I'm just gonna give a quick crash course for our application of it to our current problem.^[Also, note that there are more motivated uses-cases of `reduce()`, mostly in doing mathy-things, and I'm by no means advocating that you should _always_ use it in our context - I just think it's fun to play around with!]

All you need to know here is that `reduce()` takes a vector as its first argument, a function as its second argument, and an optional `.init` argument.^[There's also `.dir` argument that allows you to specify the direction, but not relevant here because when you pipe, the left-hand side is always the first input to the next function.] Here's a schematic:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = 500, fig.cap="From <a href='https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html'>Advanced R by Hadley Wickham</a>"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5835b80325b22f9460992f7bc9de5e0cf56de2c/27994/diagrams/functionals/reduce-init.png", error = FALSE)
```

Let me really quickly demonstrate `reduce()` in action.

Say you wanted to add up the numbers 1 through 5, but only using the plus operator `+`. You could do something like this:^[If it helps, think of it like `((((1 + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)`]

```{r}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Which is the same as this:

```{r}
reduce(1:5, `+`)
```

And if you want the start value to be something that's _not_ the first argument of the vector, pass that to the `.init` argument:

```{r}
identical(
  0.5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5,
  reduce(1:5, `+`, .init = 0.5)
)
```

If you want to be specific, you can use an {rlang}-style anonymous function where `.x` is the accumulated value being passed into the first argument fo the function and `.y` is the second argument of the function.^[The function passed into `reduce()` doesn't have to be in {rlang} anonymous function syntax, but I like it so I'll keep using it here.]

```{r}
identical(
  reduce(1:5, `+`, .init = 0.5),
  reduce(1:5, ~ .x + .y, .init = 0.5)
)
```

And two more examples just to demonstrate that directionality matters:

```{r}
identical(
  reduce(1:5, `^`, .init = 0.5),
  reduce(1:5, ~ .x ^ .y, .init = 0.5) # .x on left, .y on right
)

identical(
  reduce(1:5, `^`, .init = 0.5),
  reduce(1:5, ~ .y ^ .x, .init = 0.5) # .y on left, .x on right
)
```

That's pretty much all you need to know - let's jump right in!


## Example 1: {ggplot2}

### A reduce() solution

Recall that we had this sad code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + 
  geom_point(size = 8, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .5) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)
```

For illustrative purposes, I'm going to move the `+` "pipes" to the beginning of each line:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))
  + geom_point(size = 8, alpha = .5)
  + geom_point(size = 4, alpha = .5)
  + geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5)
```

At this point, we see a clear pattern emerge line-by-line. We start with `ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))`, which is kind of its own thing. Then we have three repetitions of `+ geom_point(size = X, alpha = .5)` where the `X` varies between 8, 4, and 2. We also notice that the sequence of calls goes from left to right, as is the normal order of piping.

Now let's translate these observations into `reduce()`. I'm bad with words so here's a visual:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '700px', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("reduce_ggplot.png", error = FALSE)
```

Let's go over what we did in our call to `reduce()` above:

- In the **first argument**, we have the vector of values that are iterated over.

- In the **second argument**, we have an anonymous function composed of...

    - The `.x` variable, which represents the accumulated value. In this context, we keep the `.x` on the left because that is the left-hand side that we are carrying over to the next call via the `+`.
    
    - The `.y` variable, which takes on values from the first argument passed into `reduce()`. In this context, `.y` will be each value of the numeric vector `c(8, 4, 2)` since `.init` is given.
    
    - The repeating function call <code>geom_point(size = .y, alpha = .5)</code> that is called with each value of the vector passed in as the first argument.

- In the **third argument** `.init`, we have `ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))` which is the non-repeating piece of code that we start with.

If you want to see the actual code run, here it is:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
reduce(
  c(8, 4, 2),
  ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y, alpha = .5),
  .init = ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg))
)
```


Let's dig in a bit more, this time with an example that looks prettier.

Suppose you want to collapse the repeated calls to `geom_point()` in this code:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
viridis_colors <- viridis::viridis(10)

mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 20, color = viridis_colors[10]) +
  geom_point(size = 18, color = viridis_colors[9]) +
  geom_point(size = 16, color = viridis_colors[8]) +
  geom_point(size = 14, color = viridis_colors[7]) +
  geom_point(size = 12, color = viridis_colors[6]) +
  geom_point(size = 10, color = viridis_colors[5]) +
  geom_point(size = 8, color = viridis_colors[4]) +
  geom_point(size = 6, color = viridis_colors[3]) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = viridis_colors[2]) +
  geom_point(size = 2, color = viridis_colors[1]) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))
```

You could do this in a couple ways:

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[Method 1]{.panel-name}

**Method 1**: Move all the "constant" parts to `.init`, since the order of these layers don't matter.

```{r, eval=F}
reduce(
    10L:1L,
    ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y * 2, color = viridis_colors[.y]),
    
    .init = mtcars %>% 
      ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
      scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
      theme_void() +
      theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))
    
)
```

:::

::: {.panel}
[Method 2]{.panel-name}

**Method 2**: Use `reduce()` in place, with the help of the {magrittr} dot `.`

```{r, eval=F}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) %>% 
  
  reduce(
    10L:1L,
    ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y * 2, color = viridis_colors[.y]),
    .init = . #<- right here!
  ) +
  
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))
```

:::

::: {.panel}
[Method 3]{.panel-name}

**Method 3**: Move all the "constant" parts to the top, wrap it in parentheses, and pass the whole thing into `.init` using the {magrittr} dot `.`

```{r, eval=F}
(mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))) %>% 
  
  reduce(
    10L:1L,
    ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y * 2, color = viridis_colors[.y]),
    .init = . #<- right here!
  )
```

:::

:::::

All in all, we see that `reduce()` gives us more succinct code!

An obvious advantage to this is that it is now really easy to make a single change that applies to all the repeated calls.

For example, if I want to make the radius of the points grow/shrink exponentially, I just need to modify the anonymous function in the second argument of `reduce()`: 

```{r, fig.align='center', dpi=300}
# Using Method 3
(mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))) %>% 
  reduce(
    10L:1L,
    ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y ^ 1.5, color = viridis_colors[.y]),  # exponential!
    .init = .
  )
```

Yay, we collapsed ten layers of `geom_point()`!^[By the way, we could also do this with `map()` since [multiple ggplot2 layers can be stored into a list and added all together in one step](https://ggplot2-book.org/programming.html#multiple-components). But then we can't do this cool thing I'm going to show with `accumulate()` next!]

### feat. accumulate()

There's actually one more thing I want to show here, which is **holding onto intermediate values** using `accumulate()`.

`accumulate()` is like `reduce()`, except instead of returning a single value which is the output of the very last function call, it keeps all intermediate values and returns them in a list.

```{r}
accumulate(1:5, `+`)
```

Check out what happens if I change `reduce()` to `accumulate()` and return each element of the resulting list:

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="25%"}
plots <- (mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(.2)) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey20"))) %>% 
  accumulate(
    10L:1L,
    ~ .x + geom_point(size = .y ^ 1.5, color = viridis_colors[.y]),
    .init = .
  )

for (i in plots) { plot(i) }
```

We got back the intermediate plots!

Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Let's animate this!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(magick)

# change ggplot2 objects into images
imgs <- map(1:length(plots), ~ {
  img <- image_graph(width = 672, height = 480)
  plot(plots[[.x]])
  dev.off()
  img
})

# combine images as frames
imgs <- image_join(imgs)

# animate
image_animate(imgs)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ggplot2_anim.gif", error = FALSE)
```


Neat! By the way, if you want a whole package dedicated to animating and incrementally building {ggplot2} code, check out [\@EvaMaeRey](https://twitter.com/EvaMaeRey)'s {[flipbookr](https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about)} package!

## Example 2: {kableExtra}

### A reduce2() solution

Recall that we had this sad code:

```{r, eval = F}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  column_spec(3, background = "skyblue") %>% 
  column_spec(4, background = "forestgreen") %>% 
  column_spec(5, background = "chocolate")
```

We've got two things varying here: the column location `3:5` and the background color `c("skyblue", "forestgreen", "chocolate")`. We  _could_ do the same trick I sneaked into the previous section by just passing one vector to `reduce()` that basically functions as an index:

```{r, eval = F}
numbers <- 3:5
background_colors <- c("skyblue", "forestgreen", "chocolate")

(mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto")) %>% 
  reduce(
    1:3,
    ~ .x %>% column_spec(numbers[.y], background = background_colors[.y]),
    .init = .
  )
```

But I want to use this opportunity to showcase `reduce2()`, which explicitly takes a _second_ varying argument to the function that you are `reduce()`-ing over.

Here, `..1` is like the `.x` and `..2` is like the `.y` from `reduce()`. The only new part is `..3` which refers to the second varying argument.

```{r, eval = F}
(mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto")) %>% 
  reduce2(
    3:5,                                           # 1st varying argument (represented by ..2)
    c("skyblue", "forestgreen", "chocolate"),      # 2nd varying argument (represented by ..3)
    ~ ..1 %>% column_spec(..2, background = ..3),
    .init = .
  )
```

We're not done yet! We can actually skip the {magrittr} pipe `%>%` and just stick `..1` as the first argument inside `column_spec()`.^[Note that we couldn't do this with `+` in our {ggplot2} example because `geom_point()` doesn't take a ggplot object as its first argument. Basically, the `+` operator is re-purposed as a class method for ggplot objects but it's kinda complicated so that's all I'll say about that.] This actually improves performance because you're removing the overhead from evaluating the pipe!

Additionally, because the pipe forces evaluation with each call unlike `+` in {ggplot2}, we don't need the parantheses wrapped around the top part of the code for the {magrittr} dot `.` to work!

Here is the final `reduce2()` solution for our sad code:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>%       # No need to wrap in parentheses!
  reduce2(
    3:5,                                          
    c("skyblue", "forestgreen", "chocolate"),  
    ~ column_spec(..1, ..2, background = ..3),  # No need for the pipe!
    .init = .
  )
```

And of course, we now have the flexibilty to do much more complicated manipulations!

```{r rainbow_table, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  reduce2(
    1:(length(mtcars)+1),                                          
    viridis::viridis(length(mtcars)+1),  
    ~ column_spec(..1, ..2, background = ..3, color = if(..2 < 5){"white"}),
    .init = .
  )
```

<aside>
The `+1` is there because the table includes row names, so there's one more "column" to color
</aside>

```{r rainbow_table, echo = FALSE}
```

### feat. accumulate2()

Yep, that's right - more animations with `accumulate()` and {magick}!

Actually, to be precise, we're going to use the `accumuate2()` here to replace our `reduce2()`.

First, we save the list of intermediate outputs to `tables`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tables <- mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% # Added to keep aspect ratio constant when saving
  accumulate2(
    1:(length(mtcars)+1),                                          
    viridis::viridis(length(mtcars)+1),  
    ~ column_spec(..1, ..2, background = ..3, color = if(..2 < 5){"white"}),
    .init = .
  )
```

Then, we save each table in `tables` as an image:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iwalk(tables, ~ save_kable(.x, file = here::here("img", paste0("table", .y, ".png")), zoom = 2))
```

Finally, we read them in and animate:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tables <- map(
  paste0("table", 1:length(tables), ".png"),
  ~ image_read(here::here("img", .x))
)

tables <- image_join(tables)

image_animate(tables)
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("table_anim.gif", error = FALSE)
```

Bet you don't see animated tables often!


## Example 3: {dplyr}

### A reduce() solution

Recall that we had this sad code:

```{r}
new_cols <- c("a", "b", "c")

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[1] := NA) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[2] := NA) %>% 
  mutate(!!new_cols[3] := NA)
```

You know the drill - a simple call to `reduce()` gets the job done!

```{r}
# Converting to tibble for nicer printing
mtcars <- as_tibble(mtcars)

mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  reduce(
    new_cols,
    ~ mutate(.x, !!.y := NA),
    .init = .
  )
```

Again, this gives you a lot of flexibility, like the ability to dynamically assign values to each column:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  reduce(
    new_cols,
    ~ mutate(.x, !!.y := paste0(.y, "-", row_number())),
    .init = .
  )
```

We can go super crazy using [context dependent expressions](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/context.html) like `cur_data()`, and do something like keeping track of the columns present at each point a new column has been created via `mutate()`:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  reduce(
    new_cols,
    ~ mutate(.x, !!.y := paste(c(names(cur_data()), .y), collapse = "-")),
    .init = .
  )
```

Here's a less crazy, more practical application of this: **explicit dummy coding**!

In R, the **factor** data structure allows implicit dummy coding, which you can access using `contrasts()`.

Here, in our data `penguins` from the {[palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/palmerpenguins.html)} package, we see that the 3-way contrast between "Adelie", "Chinstrap", and "Gentoo" in the `species` variable is treatment coded, with "Adelie" set as the reference level:

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

penguins_implicit <- penguins %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  select(species, flipper_length_mm) %>% 
  mutate(species = factor(species))

contrasts(penguins_implicit$species)
```

We can also infer that from the output of this simple linear model:^[If you aren't familiar with linear models, we know that "Adelie" is the reference level because there is no "speciesAdelie" term. The estimate for "Adelie" is represented by the "(Intercept)"!]

```{r}
broom::tidy(lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins_implicit))
```

What's cool is that you can make this 3-way treatment coding explicit by expanding the matrix into actual columns of the data!

Here's a `reduce()` solution:

```{r}
penguins_explicit <- 
  reduce(
    levels(penguins_implicit$species)[-1],
    ~ mutate(.x, !!paste0("species", .y) := as.integer(species == .y)),
    .init = penguins_implicit
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
penguins_explicit %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic(html_font = "Roboto") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "300px", extra_css = "overflow-x: auto; border: 5px solid #ddd; margin-bottom: 20px;")
```


And we get the exact same output from `lm()` when we throw in the new columns `speciesChinstrap` and `speciesGentoo` as the predictors!

```{r}
broom::tidy(lm(flipper_length_mm ~ speciesChinstrap + speciesGentoo, data = penguins_explicit))
```

By the way, if you're wondering how this is practical, some modeling packages in R (like {[lavaan](https://www.lavaan.ugent.be)} for structural equation modeling) only accept dummy coded variables that exist as independent columns/vectors, not as a metadata of a factor vector.^[Figuring this out has caused some headaches and that's what I get for not carefully reading the [docs](https://www.lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/cat.html)] This is common enough that some packages like {psych} have a function that does the same transformation we just did, called `dummy.code()`^[Except `dummy.code()` also returns a column for the reference level whose value is always `1`, which is kinda pointless]:

```{r}
bind_cols(
  penguins_implicit,
  psych::dummy.code(penguins_implicit$species)
)
```


### feat. {data.table}

Of course, you could do all of this without `reduce()` in {data.table} because its walrus `:=` is vectorized.

Here's the {data.table} solution for our sad code:

```{r}
library(data.table)
new_cols <- c("a", "b", "c")

mtcars_dt <- mtcars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  select(mpg) %>% 
  as.data.table()

mtcars_dt[, (new_cols) := NA][]
```

And here's a {data.table} solution for the explicit dummy coding example:

```{r}
penguins_dt <- as.data.table(penguins_implicit)

treatment_lvls <- levels(penguins_dt$species)[-1]
treatment_cols <- paste0("species", treatment_lvls)

penguins_dt[, (treatment_cols) := lapply(treatment_lvls, function(x){as.integer(species == x)})][]
```

I personally default to using {data.table} over {dplyr} in these cases.

## Misc.

You can also pass in a list of functions instead of a list of arguments because why not. 

For example, this replicates the very first code I showed in this blog post:

```{r}
my_funs <- list(deviation, square, mean, sqrt)

reduce(
  my_funs,
  ~ .y(.x),
  .init = nums
)
```

You could also pass in both a list of functions _and_ a list of their arguments if you really want to abstract away from, like, _literally everything_:

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
[Lawful Good]{.panel-name}

```{r}
library(janitor)

mtcars %>% 
  clean_names(case = "title") %>% 
  tabyl(2) %>% 
  adorn_rounding(digits = 2) %>% 
  adorn_totals()
```

:::

::: {.panel}
[Chaotic Evil]{.panel-name}

```{r}
janitor_funs <- list(clean_names, tabyl, adorn_rounding, adorn_totals)
janitor_args <- list(list(case = "title"), list(2), list(digits = 2), list())

reduce2(
  janitor_funs,
  janitor_args,
  ~ do.call(..2, c(list(dat = ..1), ..3)),
  .init = mtcars
)
```

Have fun reducing repetitions in your code with `reduce()`!
