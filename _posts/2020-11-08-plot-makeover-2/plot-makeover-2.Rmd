_This is the second installment of **plot makeover** where I take a plot in the wild and make very opinionated modifications to it._

## Before

Our plot-in-the-wild comes from [@Yurovsky2008MutualEI], a paper on statistical word learning. The plot that I'll be looking at here is [Figure 2]{.sc}, a bar plot of accuracy in a 3-by-3 experimental design.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Plot from Yurovsky and Yu (2008)", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("plot.png", error = FALSE)
```

As you might notice, there's something interesting going on in this bar plot. It looks like the red and green bars **stack** together but **dodge** from the blue bar. It's looks a bit weird for me as someone who mainly uses {ggplot2} because this kind of a hybrid design is not explicitly supported in the API.

For this plot makeover, I'll leave aside the issue of whether having a half-stacked, half-dodged bar plot is a good idea.^[I actually don't even have a strong feeling about this. It _does_ look kinda cool.] In fact, I'm not even gonna focus much on the "makeover" part. Instead I'm just going to take a shot at recreating this plot (likely made in MATLAB with post-processing in PowerPoint) in {ggplot2}.



## My Plan

Again, my primary goal here is replication. But I do want to touch up on some aesthetics while I'm at it.


**Major Changes**:

- Move the title to above the plot

- Move the legend inside the plot

- Move/remove the y-axis title so it's not vertically aligned

**Minor Changes**:

- Remove grid lines

- Put y-axis in percentages

- Add white borders around the bars for clearer color contrast

## After


### First draft

For a first pass on the makeover, I wanted to get the hybrid design right.

The plot below isn't quite there in terms of covering everything I laid out in my plan, but it does replicate the bar plot design specifically.


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(extrafont)

df <- tribble(
  ~Condition, ~Referent, ~Accuracy,
  "Primacy",  "Single",  0.63,
  "Primacy",  "Primacy", 0.59,
  "Recency",  "Single",  0.63,
  "Recency",  "Recency", 0.5,
  "Both",     "Single",  0.63,
  "Both",     "Primacy", 0.5,
  "Both",     "Recency", 0.31
) %>% 
  mutate(
    error_low = runif(7, .04, .06),
    error_high = runif(7, .04, .06),
    Condition_name = factor(Condition, levels = c("Primacy", "Recency", "Both")),
    Condition = as.numeric(Condition_name),
    Referent = factor(Referent, levels = c("Single", "Recency", "Primacy")),
    left = Referent == "Single",
    color = case_when(
      Referent == "Single" ~ "#29476B",
      Referent == "Primacy" ~ "#AD403D",
      Referent == "Recency" ~ "#9BBB58"
    )
  )


ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Condition, y = Accuracy, fill = color)) +
  geom_col(
    data = filter(df, left),
    width = .3,
    color = "white",
    position = position_nudge(x = -.3)
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Accuracy - error_low, ymax = Accuracy + error_high),
    data = filter(df, left),
    width = .1,
    position = position_nudge(x = -.3)
  ) +
  geom_col(
    data = filter(df, !left),
    color = "white",
    width = .3,
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(y = y, ymin = y - error_low, ymax = y + error_high),
    data = filter(df, !left) %>% 
      group_by(Condition) %>% 
      mutate(y = accumulate(Accuracy, sum)),
    width = .1
  ) +
  scale_fill_identity(
    labels = levels(df$Referent),
    guide = guide_legend(title = "Referent")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:3 - .15,
    labels = levels(df$Condition_name),
    expand = expansion(.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6),
    labels = str_remove(scales::pretty_breaks(6)(0:1), "\\.0+"),
    limits = 0:1,
    expand = expansion(0)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Exp1: Accuracy by Condition and Word Type"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
    base_family = "Roboto",
    base_size = 16
  )
```

As you might guess from my two calls to `geom_col()` and `geom_errorbar()`, I actually split the plotting of the bars into two parts. First I drew the blue bars and their errorbars, then I drew the green and red bars and their errorbars.

Effectively, the above plot is a combination of these two:^[I used a neat trick from the [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figures-side.html) to get the plots printed side-by-side]

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.show = "hold"}
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Condition, y = Accuracy, fill = color)) +
  geom_col(
    data = filter(df, left),
    width = .3,
    color = "white",
    position = position_nudge(x = -.3)
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = Accuracy - error_low, ymax = Accuracy + error_high),
    data = filter(df, left),
    width = .1,
    position = position_nudge(x = -.3)
  ) +
  scale_fill_identity(
    labels = levels(df$Referent),
    guide = guide_legend(title = "Referent")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:3 - .15,
    labels = levels(df$Condition_name),
    expand = expansion(.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6),
    labels = str_remove(scales::pretty_breaks(6)(0:1), "\\.0+"),
    limits = 0:1,
    expand = expansion(0)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Exp1: Accuracy by Condition and Word Type"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
    base_family = "Roboto",
    base_size = 16
  )

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Condition, y = Accuracy, fill = color)) +
  geom_col(
    data = filter(df, !left),
    color = "white",
    width = .3,
  ) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(y = y, ymin = y - error_low, ymax = y + error_high),
    data = filter(df, !left) %>% 
      group_by(Condition) %>% 
      mutate(y = accumulate(Accuracy, sum)),
    width = .1
  ) +
  scale_fill_identity(
    labels = levels(df$Referent),
    guide = guide_legend(title = "Referent")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = 1:3 - .15,
    labels = levels(df$Condition_name),
    expand = expansion(.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(6),
    labels = str_remove(scales::pretty_breaks(6)(0:1), "\\.0+"),
    limits = 0:1,
    expand = expansion(0)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Exp1: Accuracy by Condition and Word Type"
  ) +
  theme_classic(
    base_family = "Roboto",
    base_size = 16
  )
```

A bit hacky I guess but it works!
