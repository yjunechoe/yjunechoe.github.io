Beach, CA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing a &lt;a
href="https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2023-12-18-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a
href="https://yabellini.netlify.app/blog/2023-12-23-year-review/"&gt;folks&lt;/a&gt;
on Mastodon sharing their “year in review” blog posts, and I thought
that was really cool, so I decided to write my own too! I’m mostly
documenting for myself but hopefully this also serves as an update of a
sort for my friends over the internet since I’ve been pretty silent
online this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="research"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the Good Grad Student™ I am, I’m forefronting my academia
happenings first. In numbers, I published &lt;strong&gt;one paper&lt;/strong&gt;,
gave &lt;strong&gt;two talks&lt;/strong&gt;, and presented &lt;strong&gt;three
posters&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m not super proud of those numbers: I think they’re
a lot less than what people might expect from a 4th year PhD student.
But a lot of effort went into each&lt;a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2023 overall has been a great year for
refining and narrowing down on my dissertation topic.&lt;a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I did a ton of
readings and I hope it pays off for next year when I actually get
started on writing the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already document my research happenings &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/research.html"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; and I
know that the primarily audience of my blog isn’t linguists, so I won’t
expand on that more here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blogging"&gt;Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 was the year when it became &lt;a
href="https://fosstodon.org/@yjunechoe/110437295974710184"&gt;painfully
obvious to me&lt;/a&gt; that I don’t have much in terms of a
&lt;em&gt;portfolio&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of the buzzword-y “data science
portfolio” that industry recruiters purportedly look for. This
ironically coincided with another realization I had, which is that I’m
increasingly becoming “the department tech/stats guy” where I take on
many small tasks and favors from faculty and other students here and
there; I truly do enjoy doing this work, but it’s completely invisible
to my CV/resume. I’m still navigating this weird position I’m in, but
I’ve found some nice tips&lt;a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and at least I still have another year
until I’m on the job market to fully figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I put the above rant under the “Blogging” section is
because &lt;strong&gt;my blog is the closest thing I have a portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;
- there’s not much here, but it’s a public-facing space I own where I
get to show people what I know and how I think. So in 2023 I was more
conscious about what I blog about and how. The change was subtle - my
blog persona is still my usual self, but I’ve tried to &lt;strong&gt;diversify
the &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt; of my blogs&lt;/strong&gt;. Whereas I mostly wrote
long-form, tutorial-style blog posts in the past, I only wrote one such
post (&lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-06-11-row-relational-operations/"&gt;on
&lt;code&gt;dplyr::slice()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) this year. My other blog posts were one
reflecting on &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-07-09-x-y-problem/"&gt;how to
better answer other people’s questions&lt;/a&gt;, and another where I &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2023-12-03-untidy-select/"&gt;nerd
out on the internals of {tidyselect}&lt;/a&gt; with little regard for its
practicality.&lt;a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I wrote &lt;strong&gt;three blog posts&lt;/strong&gt; this year (not
including this one). This is the usual rate of publishing blog posts for
me, but I hope to write more frequently next year (and write shorter
posts overall, and in less formal tone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r-stuff"&gt;R stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I’d have much to say about the R stuff I did this year
until I sat down to write this blog. Even though this year was the
busiest I’ve ever been with research, it turns out that I still ended up
doing quite a bit of R stuff in my free time. I’ll cover this
chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/logo.png" style="width:20%;margin:1em auto;display:block;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I was really lucky to receive the &lt;a
href="https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/student-paper-competition"&gt;student
paper award&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a
href="https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/home"&gt;Statistical
Computing and Graphics section of the ASA&lt;/a&gt;, writing about &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/"&gt;{ggtrace}&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/static/papers/Choe_2022_SublayerGG.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;,
I focused on &lt;code&gt;{ggtrace}&lt;/code&gt; as a pedagogical tool for aspiring
&lt;code&gt;{ggplot2}&lt;/code&gt; extension developers. In the process, I
rediscovered the power of &lt;strong&gt;reframing ggplot internals as data
wrangling&lt;/strong&gt; and went back to &lt;code&gt;{ggtrace}&lt;/code&gt; to add a
couple &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/news/index.html#ggtrace-development-version-3"&gt;convenience
functions&lt;/a&gt; for interactive use-cases. After over two years since its
inception, &lt;code&gt;{ggtrace}&lt;/code&gt; now feels pretty complete in terms of
its core features (but suggestions and requests are always
welcome!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/logo.png" style="width:20%;margin:1em auto;display:block;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spring, I began writing &lt;a
href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/"&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/a&gt;,
a statistical package implementing the cluster-based permutation test
for time series data, using mixed-effects models. This was a new
challenge for me for two reasons. First, I wrote much of the package &lt;a
href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm/tree/main/inst/julia/JlmerClusterPerm/src"&gt;in
Julia&lt;/a&gt; - this was my first time writing Julia code for “production”
and within an R package.&lt;a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Second, I wrote this package for a seminar
on eye movements that I was taking that Spring in the psychology
department. I wrote &lt;code&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/code&gt; in an intense burst
- most of it was complete by the end of May and I turned in the package
as my final.&lt;a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I also gave a school-internal &lt;a
href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/calendar_event/ilst-seminar-students/"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;
on it in April; my first time talking about R in front of an entirely
academic audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Summer, I continued polishing &lt;code&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/code&gt; with
another ambitious goal of getting it to CRAN, at the suggestion of a
couple researchers who said they’d like to use it for their own
research. The already-hard task of getting through &lt;strong&gt;my first CRAN
submission&lt;/strong&gt; was compounded by the fact that the package
contained Julia code - it took &lt;em&gt;nine resubmissions in the span of two
months&lt;/em&gt; to finally get &lt;code&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/code&gt; stably on
CRAN.&lt;a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of Fall, I attended the &lt;a
href="https://repsychling.github.io/SMLP2023/"&gt;Advanced Frequentist
stream&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a
href="https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2023/"&gt;SMLP2023&lt;/a&gt; workshop,
taught by Phillip Alday, Reinhold Kliegl and Douglas Bates. The topic
was &lt;strong&gt;mixed-effects regression models in Julia&lt;/strong&gt;, one that
I became very excited about especially after working on
&lt;code&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/code&gt;. It was an absolute blast and I wish
that everyone in linguistics/psychology research appreciated good
stats/data analysis as much as the folks I met there. The workshop was
far away in Germany (my first time ever in Europe!) and I’m really
thankful to &lt;a href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/"&gt;MindCORE&lt;/a&gt; for
giving me a grant to help with travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/logo.png" style="width:20%;margin:1em auto;display:block;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of Fall, I didn’t do much R stuff, especially with the start
of the Fall semester and a big conference looming on the horizon. But
the little time I did spend on it, I worked on maintenance and upkeep
for &lt;code&gt;{openalexR}&lt;/code&gt;, one of my few collaborative projects. It’s
also one of the few packages for which I’m an author of that I actually
frequently use myself. I used &lt;code&gt;{openalexR}&lt;/code&gt; a lot during the
Fall semester for conducting literature reviews in preparation for my
dissertation proposal, so I had a few opportunities to catch bugs and
work on other improvements. I also spent a lot of my time in the Fall
TA-ing for an &lt;a
href="https://kathrynschuler.com/datasci/"&gt;undergraduate data science
class&lt;/a&gt; that we recently started offering in our department. This was
actually my third year in a row TA-ing it, so it went pretty smoothly. I
even learned some new &lt;a
href="https://fosstodon.org/@yjunechoe/111026163637396686"&gt;quirky R
behaviors&lt;/a&gt; from my students along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/figures/logo.svg" style="width:20%;margin:1em auto;display:block;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, I virtually attended the &lt;a
href="https://rinpharma.com/"&gt;R/Pharma conference&lt;/a&gt; and joined a &lt;a
href="https://github.com/rich-iannone/pointblank-workshop"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;
on data validation using the &lt;code&gt;{pointblank}&lt;/code&gt; package by &lt;a
href="https://github.com/rich-iannone"&gt;Rich Iannone&lt;/a&gt;. I had used
&lt;code&gt;{pointblank}&lt;/code&gt; a little before, but I didn’t explore its
features much because I thought it had some odd behaviors that I
couldn’t comprehend. The workshop cleared up some of the confusion for
me, and Rich made it clear in the workshop that he welcomed
contributions to improve the package. So I &lt;a
href="https://github.com/rstudio/pointblank/pull/493"&gt;made a PR&lt;/a&gt;
addressing the biggest pain point I personally had with using
&lt;code&gt;{pointblank}&lt;/code&gt;. This turned out to be a pretty big
undertaking which took over a month to complete. In the process, I
become a co-author of &lt;code&gt;{pointblank}&lt;/code&gt;, and I merged a series
of PRs that improved the consistency of function designs, among other
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last R thing I did this year was actually secretly Julia - in
December I gave a school-internal &lt;a
href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/MindCORE-julia-mixedmodels"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;
on fitting mixed effects in Julia, geared towards an academic audience
with prior experience in R. I advocated for a middle-ground approach
where you can keep doing everything in R and RStudio, except move just
the modelling workflow into Julia. I live-coded some Julia code and ran
it from RStudio, which I think wasn’t too difficult to grasp.&lt;a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I have a
half-baked package of addins to make R-Julia interoperability smoother
in RStudio; I hope to wrap it up and share it some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the present moment, where I’m currently taking a
break from FOSS to focus on my research, as my dissertation proposal
defense is coming up soon. I will continue to be responsive with
maintaining &lt;code&gt;{jlmerclusterperm}&lt;/code&gt; during this time (since
there’s an active user-base of researchers who find it useful) but my
other projects will become low priority. I also don’t think I’ll be
starting a new project any time soon, but in the near future I hope I
come up with something cool that lets me test-drive
&lt;code&gt;{S7}&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="personal"&gt;Personal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I tried to be less of a workaholic. I think I did an okay
job at it, and it mostly came in the form of diversifying my hobbies (R
used to be my only hobby since starting grad school). I got back into
ice skating&lt;a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and, briefly, swimming,&lt;a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I’m fortunate
that both are available literally two blocks away from my department. My
girlfriend and I got really into escape rooms this year, mostly playing
online ones due to budget constraints.&lt;a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I also got back into
playing Steam games&lt;a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and racked up over 300 hours on &lt;a
href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/"&gt;Slay
the Spire&lt;/a&gt;, mostly from the ~2 weeks recovering from covid in
September.&lt;a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, I have many people to thank for making this a
wonderful year.&lt;a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Happy new year to all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="r distill-force-highlighting-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was the first author for all research that I
presented, as is often the case in linguistics.&lt;a href="#fnref1"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn2"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, how kids learn words with overlapping meanings
like “dalmatian”&amp;lt;“dog”&amp;lt;“animal” from the language input.&lt;a
href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a
href="https://www.phillipalday.com/blog/2013/02/19/Backups-Your-Relationship-to-Your-Data-and-Your-IT-Guy/"&gt;this
blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A style heavily inspired by some of my favorite R
bloggers like &lt;a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/"&gt;Matt Dray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
href="https://jcarroll.com.au/"&gt;Jonathan Carroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#fnref4"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, my girlfriend also won a student award
this year from another ASA - the Acoustical Society of America.&lt;a
href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t recommend &lt;code&gt;{JuliaConnectoR}&lt;/code&gt; enough
for this.&lt;a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m actually quite proud of myself for pulling this off
- writing an R package for the final was unprecedented for the class.&lt;a
href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process, I received the elusive CRAN Note for
exceeding 6 updates in under a month (CRAN recommends one update every
1-2 months).&lt;a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using some tricks described in the workshop materials.&lt;a
href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to play ice hockey competitively as a kid.&lt;a
href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out that swimming does not play well with my
preexisting ear conditions.&lt;a href="#fnref11"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently we played &lt;a
href="https://wolfescapegames.com/en-us/products/hallows-hill-the-virtual-escape-room-experience"&gt;Hallows
Hill&lt;/a&gt; which I think is the best one we’ve played so far&lt;a
href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m very into roguelike genres but haven’t really
played video games since high school.&lt;a href="#fnref13"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fellow nerds, I reached A20 on Ironclad,
Defect, and Watcher. I’m working my way up for Silent.&lt;a href="#fnref14"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling shy so this goes in the footnotes. In
roughly chronological order, I’m firstly indebted to Sam Tyner-Monroe
who encouraged me write up &lt;code&gt;{ggtrace}&lt;/code&gt; for the ASA paper
award after my rstudio::conf talk on it last year. I’m grateful to Gina
Reynolds and Teun van den Brand (and others in the &lt;a
href="https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club"&gt;ggplot
extension club&lt;/a&gt;) for engaging in many insightful data viz/ggplot
internals discussions with me. I’m also grateful to my FOSS
collaborators, especially Trang Le, from whom I’ve learned a lot about
code review and package design principles while working on
&lt;code&gt;{openalexR}&lt;/code&gt; together. Last but not least, I owe a lot to
Daniel Sjoberg and Shannon Pileggi for a recent development that I’m not
ready to publicly share yet 🤫.&lt;a href="#fnref15"
class="footnote-back"&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
