My main research interest is in modeling how comprehenders parse linguistic input, both in real time and at different stages of language development.\r\nI received my B.A. in Linguistics from Northwestern University (’20), where I worked with Jennifer Cole, Masaya Yoshida, and Annette D’Onofrio. I also worked as a research assistant in the Language, Education, and Reading Neuroscience Lab under Elizabeth Norton in the Communication Sciences and Disorders Department. I wrote my honors thesis on the role of prosodic focus in semantic reanalysis in the processing of sentences with local attachment ambiguity.\r\nBeyond linguistics research, I have interests in data visualization, science communication, literate programming, and the R language. I’m especially passionate about explanatory data viz in academic research and spend a lot of time thinking about best practices for readability and accessibility.\r\nI’m also a MindCORE affiliate and work as a data science tutor for researchers at Penn. You can schedule an appointment with me if you have questions related to R and/or data visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact me: yj{last_name}@sas.upenn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
