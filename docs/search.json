I am a psycholinguist broadly interested in\r\nexperimental approaches to studying meaning, of various flavors. I use\r\ncomputational and behavioral methods to study how comprehenders parse\r\nlinguistic input, both in real time and at different stages of language\r\ndevelopment. My advisor is Anna Papafragou and I am a member of the Language & Cognition Lab.\r\nI received my B.A. in Linguistics from Northwestern University, where\r\nI worked with Jennifer\r\nCole, Masaya\r\nYoshida, and Annette\r\nD’Onofrio. I also worked as a research assistant for the Language, Education, and\r\nReading Neuroscience Lab). I wrote my thesis on the role of\r\nprosodically-marked semantic focus in the reanalysis of garden-path\r\nsentences.\r\nBeyond linguistics research, I have interests in data visualization,\r\nscience communication, and the R programming language. I develop R packages and blog about these topics\r\nin my spare time as a hobby. I’m especially passionate about improving\r\nexplanatory data viz in academic research and strongly believe that\r\nstyle is just as important as content. I am also work\r\nas a data science tutor for researchers at Penn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact me: \r\nyjchoe@sas.upenn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
