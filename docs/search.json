I am a psycholinguist broadly interested in experimental approaches to studying meaning, of various flavors. I use computational and behavioral methods to study how comprehenders process and represent linguistic ambiguity, both in real time and at different stages of language development. My advisor is Anna Papafragou and I am a member of the Language & Cognition Lab.\r\nI received my B.A. in Linguistics from Northwestern University, where I worked with Jennifer Cole, Masaya Yoshida, and Annette D’Onofrio. I also worked as a research assistant for the Language, Education, and Reading Neuroscience Lab. My thesis explored the role of prosodically-marked semantic focus in garden-path reanalysis.\r\nBeyond linguistics research, I have interests in data visualization, science communication, and the R programming language. I actively develop (ggtrace, jlmerclusterperm) and contribute to (openalexR) open source software and maintain a technical blog as a hobby. I also work as a data science tutor as part of a MindCORE program, and occasionally take on small statistical consulting projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact me:  yjchoe@sas.upenn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I will be joining the “Advanced methods in frequentist statistics with Julia” stream. Huge thanks to MindCORE for funding my travels to attend!\r\nJanuary\r\nI received the ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics student award for my paper Sublayer modularity in the Grammar of Graphics! I will be presenting my work at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings in Toronto in August.\r\n2022\r\nSeptember\r\nI was invited to a Korean data science podcast dataholic (데이터홀릭) to talk about my experience presenting at the RStudio and useR conferences! Part 1, Part 2\r\nAugust\r\nI led a workshop on IBEX and PCIbex with Nayoun Kim at the Seoul International Conference on Linguistics (SICOL 2022).\r\nJuly\r\nI attended my first in-person R conference at rstudio::conf(2022) and gave a talk on ggplot internals.\r\nJune\r\nI gave a talk on my package {ggtrace} at the useR! 2022 conference.

My reflections\r\nI gave a talk at RLadies philly on using dplyr’s slice() function for row-relational operations.\r\n2021\r\nJuly\r\nMy tutorial on custom fonts in R was featured as a highlight on the R Weekly podcast!\r\nJune\r\nI gave a talk at RLadies philly on using icon fonts for data viz! I also wrote a follow-up blog post that goes deeper into font rendering in R.\r\nMay\r\nSnowGlobe, a project started in my undergrad, was featured in an article by the Northwestern University Library. We also had a workshop for SnowGlobe which drew participants from over a hundred universities!\r\nJanuary\r\nI joined Nayoun Kim for a workshop on experimental syntax conducted in Korean and held at Sungkyunkwan University (Korea). I helped design materials for a session on scripting online experiments with IBEX, including interactive slides made with R!\r\n2020\r\nNovember\r\nI joined designer Will Chase on his stream to talk about the psycholinguistics of speech production for a data viz project on Michael’s speech errors in The Office. It was a very cool and unique opportunity to bring my two interests together!\r\nOctober\r\nMy tutorial on {ggplot2} stat_*() functions was featured as a highlight on the R Weekly podcast, which curates weekly updates from the R community.\r\nI became a data science tutor at MindCORE to help researchers at Penn with data visualization and R programming.\r\nSeptember\r\nI have moved to Philadelphia to start my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania!\r\nJune\r\nI graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in Linguistics (with honors)!
