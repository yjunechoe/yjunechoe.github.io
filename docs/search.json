I am a psycholinguist broadly\r\ninterested in experimental approaches to studying meaning, of various\r\nflavors. I use computational and behavioral methods to study how\r\ncomprehenders parse linguistic input, both in real time and at different\r\nstages of language development. My advisor is Anna Papafragou and I am a\r\nmember of the Language &\r\nCognition Lab.\r\nI received my B.A. in Linguistics from Northwestern University, where\r\nI worked with Jennifer\r\nCole, Masaya\r\nYoshida, and Annette\r\nD’Onofrio. I also worked as a research assistant for (and still\r\ncollaborate with) the Language, Education, and\r\nReading Neuroscience Lab) in Communication Sciences and Disorders. I\r\nwrote my thesis on the role of prosodic focus in the processing of\r\ngarden-path sentences.\r\nBeyond linguistics research, I have interests in data visualization,\r\nscience communication, and the R programming language. I read and blog about these topics\r\nin my spare time as a hobby. I’m especially passionate about improving\r\nexplanatory data viz in academic research and strongly believe that\r\nstyle is just as important as content. I am also a Penn MindCORE student\r\naffiliate and work as a data science tutor for researchers at Penn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact me: \r\nyjchoe@sas.upenn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
