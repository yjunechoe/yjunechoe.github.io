I use computational and behavioral methods to study how comprehenders parse linguistic input, both in real time and at different stages of language development.\r\nI received my B.A. in Linguistics from Northwestern University, where I worked with Jennifer Cole, Masaya Yoshida, and Annette D’Onofrio. I also worked as a research assistant for (and still collaborate with) the Language, Education, and Reading Neuroscience Lab (P.I. Elizabeth Norton) in Communication Sciences and Disorders. I wrote my thesis on the role of prosodic focus in semantic reanalysis in the processing of garden-path sentences with local attachment ambiguity.\r\nBeyond linguistics research, I have interests in data visualization, science communication, and the R programming language. I’m especially passionate about explanatory data viz in academic research and strongly believe that style is just as important as content. I blog about these topics in my spare time as a hobby.\r\nI am also a Penn MindCORE student affiliate and work as a data science tutor for researchers at Penn. You can schedule an appointment with me if you have questions related to R and/or data visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact me:  yjchoe@sas.upenn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
