## 2020

### October

- My [tutorial](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-demystifying-stat-layers-ggplot2/) on stat_*() functions in {ggplot2} was **featured as a weekly highlight** on the [rweekly podcast](https://rweekly.fireside.fm/8?t=251), which curates weekly updates from the R community

- I became a **data science tutor** at [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/) to help researchers at Penn with issues related to data visualization and R programming.

### September

- **I have moved to Philly to start my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania!**

- I presented a **poster at AMLaP** on my undergrad thesis research, advised by Professors Jennifer Cole and Masaya Yoshida.

### June

- **I graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in Linguistics!** I was also appointed as the Senior Marshal for Linguistics (though missed out on the chance to carry a banner representing the major at graduation)
