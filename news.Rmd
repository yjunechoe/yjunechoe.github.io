## 2021

### January

- I joined [Dr. Nayoun Kim](https://nayounkimlinguist.com/) for a [workshop on experimental syntax](https://skb.skku.edu/bk21english/board/notice.do?mode=view&articleNo=110726&article.offset=0&articleLimit=10) held at Sungkyunkwan University (Korea). I helped design [materials](https://github.com/yjunechoe/IBEX-Workshop-Materials) for a session on scripting online experiments with IBEX, including [interactive slides](https://ibex-workshop-slides.netlify.app/) made with R!


## 2020

### November

- I joined designer [Will Chase](https://www.williamrchase.com/) on his [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0NVmQXYjac) to talk about the psycholinguistics of speech production for a data viz project on Michael's speech errors in The Office. It was a very cool and unique opportunity to bring my two interests together!

### October

- My [tutorial](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2020-09-26-demystifying-stat-layers-ggplot2/) on stat_*() functions in {ggplot2} was **featured as a highlight** on the [rweekly podcast](https://rweekly.fireside.fm/8?t=251), which curates weekly updates from the R community.

- I became a **data science tutor** at [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/) to help researchers at Penn with data visualization and R programming.

### September

- I have moved to Philadelphia to **start my PhD in Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania**!

- I presented a **poster at AMLaP** on my undergrad thesis research with my advisors Jennifer Cole and Masaya Yoshida.

### June

- **I graduated from Northwestern University** with a B.A. in Linguistics! I was also elected into Phi Beta Kappa and appointed as the Senior Marshal for Linguistics.
